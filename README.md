# finite_time_allocation_paper
 Repository containing all the Julia code used for paper "Optimal allocation of finite sampling capacity in accumulator models of multialternative decision making"

All the functions are in the accumulator_functions.jl module.
The jupyter notebook "Paper_notebook.ipynb" can reproduce all the figures presented in the manuscript.

Some documentation is available for all the main functions. You can query all functions to check their usage with '?function', where you replace 'function' with the one you are interested in.
